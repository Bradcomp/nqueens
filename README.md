# nqueens
Haskell n-queens solver

You can load it in ghci and run the solve command with a number.  It slows down above a board size of 16 or so.

Currently uses a depth first search with backtrcking and pruning of dead locations.

## TODO
* Make a hill climbing version to handle larger board sizes.
